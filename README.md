# Pig Game Enhancement

## Overview

 Inspired by **@jonasschmedtmann** whose js instructor and online teacher


This project is an enhancement of a simple Pig game implementation. The Pig game is a classic dice game where players take turns rolling dice to accumulate points while trying to avoid rolling a 1 and losing all their points. This README will provide an overview of the enhancements made to the game, how to run the code, and how to contribute to the project.

## Enhancements

 #### 1. Player Names
 - The original game only allowed for anonymous players. In this enhancement, players can enter their names at the beginning of the game for a more personalized experience.

 #### 2. Target Score Setting
 - The original game had a fixed target score (usually 100 points). In this enhancement, players can choose the target score at the start of the game.
 
 #### 3. Rule Variation
 - We've included an option to play with a variation that penalizes double 1s (snake eyes) by resetting the player's score to zero.

 #### 4. Score History
 - Keep track of each player's turn-by-turn score history to provide a more detailed view of the game's progression.
