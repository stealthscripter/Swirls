         <ul>
              <p>Setup</p>
            <li>Gather your players and sit in a circle or around a table</li>
            <li>Input Your Name in Input Fields</li>
              <p>Taking Turns</p>
            <li>Players take turns rolling the two dice.</li>
            <li>On your turn, you can choose to roll the dice as many times as you like, adding up the points from each roll. The catch is that if you roll a "1" on one or both of the dice, you lose all the points accumulated during that turn, and your turn is over.</li>
              <p>Scoring</p>
            <li>Roll two dice and add up the values. For example, if you roll a 3 and a 4, your total is 7.</li>
            <li>You can choose to roll again to accumulate more points or stop and keep the points you've earned during your turn.</li>
              <p>Holding Points</p>
            <li>You can decide to "hold" at any point during your turn by passing the dice to the next player. When you hold, the points you've accumulated during that turn are added to your total score.</li>
              <p>Pig Out</p>
            <li>If you roll a 1 on one or both dice during your turn, you lose all the points earned in that turn, and your turn is over. This is known as "pigging out."</li>
              <p>Winning the Game</p>
            <li>The game continues with players taking turns until one player reaches or exceeds the target score (usually 100 points). The first player to do so wins the game.</li>
         </ul>
